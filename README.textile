h1. Textile for Arc

This is a (currently imcomplete) implementation of Textile in Arc. The goal is to provide a more complete implementation of Textile than pg's implementation of Markdown. Despite its incompleteness, it is already a workable language for simple documents.

h2. Changelog

h3. Version 0.1

Initial release. Supports blocks with attributes for class, style, and lang, but not id, and all the spans without attributes.
